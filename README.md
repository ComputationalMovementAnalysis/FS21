# Todos for FS2022

- remove hierarchical level */solutions/*, since this level is not necessary (Rscripts could be in 11_Week1/*)
- replace `lubridate` with `clock`
- move from bookdown to distill (?)
- consider moving `sf` and `terra` into later weeks...
- if we use utterances, everyone needs to subscribe to the repo
- don't duplicate prerequisites and reading assignments
- update the learning outcomes, they are outdated!

# ToDos for FS2021:

- can we port this whole thing to github.com and use github actions?
- can we make this an OER?
- can we work with preview_chapter() so that the Module Research Methods will run smoother next semester?
