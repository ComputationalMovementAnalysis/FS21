# Todos for FS2022

- replace `lubridate` with `clock`
- move from bookdown to distill (?)
- consider moving `sf` and `terra` into later weeks...


# ToDos for FS2021:

- can we port this whole thing to github.com and use github actions?
- can we make this an OER?
- can we work with preview_chapter() so that the Module Research Methods will run smoother next semester?
