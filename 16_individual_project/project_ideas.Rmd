## Possible topics

- In Lesson 3 (Task 1) we implemented @laube2011 concept by using a fixed number of "offsets" `lead()` and `lag()`. However, this provides an issues with varying sampling intervals. Can you think of a way to implement the algorithm by specifying a temporal window size, rather than an offset?
- Implement recurse package from Chloe Bracis
- Implement Meet pattern from CMAtools
