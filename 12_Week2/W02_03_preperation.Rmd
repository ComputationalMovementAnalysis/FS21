## Preperation


### Update `R` and RStudio


Last week, we showed you how to determine whether your `R` Version or your RStudio needs updating (see [Preperation](#w1-preperation)). If your versions are up to date: Great! If not, update these before today's session.


### Install and configure Git

You will need Git again this week. If you had issues last week installing or configuring Git to work with RStudio, make sure you debug these problems now. Consult the [chapter on troubleshooting](https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html) in Jenny Brian's book "Happy Git with R".


### Create a Github account

Last week, you worked with git on your local machine, with no way of synchronising your changes with a cloud server. This week, you will use Github to sync your changes. To do this, create a Github account on [github.com](https://github.com/) (it's free of course). Use the email address that you [configured in git last week](#introduce-yourself-git). If you are not sure which mail you used, type `git config user.email` in the console. 

You don't have to use the same `user.name` on Github as use configured in Git. When choosing a username on Github, consider the following tips: 

- incorporating your actual name is nice, people like to know who they are dealing with
- choose a name that you are comfortable revealing it to a future boss
- shorter is better than longer
- make it timeless (e.g. don't incorporate your university's name)



### Authenticate Git to work with Github

If we want to push changes from our local repository to our Github Cloud, Github must verify your credentials. Other software might just ask for your username and password, it's a little different with Git. Basically there are two ways to connect with your remote repo (ssh and https), we will use https in this course. **This is a one time set up per computer**, you need to do this only once. 

- **Step 1**: Create a personal access token (PAT) on Github
  - Login into github.com, click on your user profile (top right) and click on "Settings" ([github.com/settings](https://github.com/settings))
  - Choose "Personal access tokens" > Generate new token
  - Add a descriptive note (e.g. `https access from my personal laptop`)
  - Select scope "repo"
  - Click on "Generate token"
  - Copy your new personal access token (in the green box). **You won’t be able to see it again!** 
  - Treat this PAT like a password: Store it in a secure place, like a password management app if you have one (which you should!). *Never publish this PAT publicly*.
- **Step 2**: Store your PAT in you local Git
  - In R, install the `gitcreds` package (via `install.packages("gitcreds")`)
  - Call the function `gitcreds_set()` (via `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`)
  - Respond to the prompt with your PAT
  - (You can check that you have stored a credential with `gitcreds::gitcreds_get()`)
  
  
### Create a Git**hub** repo

Now you can create a Repository on Github that you can afterwards connect to your RStudio project from week 1. This is something you have to do for every Git repo that you want to connect to Github. To do this go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and fill in the following information:

- Repository name: Give a meaningful name, e.g.  `cma-week1`
- Description: Give a meaningful description, e.g. `Solving exercise 1 of the course "Computational Movement Analysis`
- Make the repo public, not private
- Make sure that `Add a README file`, `Add .gitignore ` and `Choose a license` are all *un*checked
- Click on `Create repository`

You will be forwarded to a new page with instructions. You can switch between instructions for `https` and `SSH` by clicking on the appropriate button. Make sure you choose `https`, keep this page open and open RStudio.


### Connect your local repo with the remote repository

In RStudio, open the RStudio project from week 1. Open the terminal and follow the instructions described in *…or push an existing repository from the command line* in the website you were just forwarded to on Github (under https://github.com/yourgithubusername/cma-week1). These instructions should look something like this:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourgithubusername/cma-week1.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Type these commands line by line into your terminal. If you want to copy and paste the commands rather than type them: Note that ctrl + V for "pasting" won't work via the keyboard shortcut, you will have to paste by right clicking into the terminal and choosing "paste".
