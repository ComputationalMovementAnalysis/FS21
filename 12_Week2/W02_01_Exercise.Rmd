## Tasks and Inputs

### Input 1: Using dpyr for data wrangling

Depending on your knowledge of `R`, getting an overview of the data we imported last week might have been quite a challenge. Quite surprisingly, importing, cleaning and exploring your data can be the most challenging, time consuming part of a project. RStudio and the tidyverse offer many helpful tools to make this part easier (and more fun). You have read chapters on `dplyr` and `magrittr` as preparation for this Exercise. In the next task, we will use these tools (`dplyr`, `group_by`, `summarise`) to get an overview of the data. Let's start with an example to illustrate the concept:

To calculate the timelag in between subsequent positions, we can use the function `difftime()` combined with `lead()` from `dplyr`. Wihout `muatate()`, the code looks something like this:

```{r, echo = T, eval = F, include= T}
wildschwein_BE$timelag  <- difftime(lead(wildschwein_BE$DatetimeUTC),wildschwein_BE$DatetimeUTC)
```

We mention `wildschwein_BE` three times in this function, which is why we can use `summarise()`:
```{r, echo = T, eval = F, include= T}
wildschwein_BE  <- wildschwein_BE %>% 
  mutate(
    timelag = difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC),DatetimeUTC)
  )
                                            
```
With the code above, we did not consider that `timelag` should just be calculated between subsequent rows *of the same individual*. We can implement this by using `group_by()`. In addition, we can specify `units =` to ensure we're getting the time difference in the units we prefer, and `as.numeric()` to turn the `difftime()` object into a numeric value (which is easier to plot etc.).

```{r}
wildschwein_BE <- wildschwein_BE %>%
  group_by(TierID) %>%
  mutate(
    timelag = difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC),DatetimeUTC,units = "mins"),
    timelag = as.numeric(timelag)
  )
```


### Task 1: Getting an Overview


Try to answer the following questions:

- How many individuals were tracked? 
- How long were the individual tracked? Are there gaps?
- Were all individuals tracked concurrently or sequentially? 
- What is the temporal sampling interval between the locations?




Here are some sample visualisation that help answer these questions:
```{r, echo = F, eval = T, include=T}
## Task 1 ####################

ggplot(wildschwein_BE, aes(DatetimeUTC,TierID)) +
  geom_line()

ggplot(wildschwein_BE, aes(timelag)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50)

ggplot(wildschwein_BE, aes(timelag)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  lims(x = c(0,100)) +
  scale_y_log10()

wildschwein_BE[1:50,] %>%
  ggplot(aes(DatetimeUTC,timelag)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()


```

### Input 2: Grouping by intervals

For the next Task, we will need a function to split a continuous variable into specific intervals. For this, the function `cut()`is very handy. Let's introduce this function with a quick example. Take an a series of number that represent the age of ten different people.

```{r, echo = T, eval = T, include = T}
ages <- c(20,25,18,13,53,50,23,43,68,40)
```
Let's say we want to split this into equal intervals of 10

```{r, echo = T, eval = T, include = T}
breaks <- seq(0,50,10)

cut(ages,breaks = breaks)
```
Note:

- If a number does not fit within an interval defined by `breaks =`, `cut()` will return `NA`.
- The default `labels` with `(` and `]` might seem a little ugly and puzzling at first, but in fact they are [a standard form of notating intervals in mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28mathematics%29#Notations_for_intervals)
- If you don't like `(` and `]`, you can specify your own labels with the argument `labels =` (see below)



```{r, echo = T, eval = T, include = T}
cut(ages, breaks = c(0,30,60,100), labels = c("young","middle aged","old"))
```



### Task 2: Making groups by sampling Interval

Now that we've established that we have different sampling intervals (Task 1), we have to segment our trajectories in such a way, that we can perform further analysis during specific sampling intervals only. If we measure speed, or turning angles, we have to be very clear on what temporal (an thus spatial) scale we are performing this analysis. 

We therefore have to define threshold to group segments with a similar sampling interval. Explore the dataset in more detail (e.g. using histograms at different scales), and choose reasonable threshold values to group the trajectories into different sampling intervals. 

Note: 

- It might make more sense to choose narrow group intervals at smaller time lags and wider groups intervals at higher time lags.
- Store the group names in a new column named `samplingInt`


```{r}
## Task 2 ####################

ggplot(wildschwein_BE, aes(timelag)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,400,20),limits = c(0,400)) +
  # scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,50,1),limits = c(0,50)) +
  scale_y_log10()

wildschwein_BE <- wildschwein_BE %>%
  group_by(TierID) %>%
  mutate(
    samplingInt = cut(timelag,breaks = c(0,5,seq(10,195,15)))
  ) 

wildschwein_BE %>%
  group_by(samplingInt) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n()
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(samplingInt,n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_log10()


```


### Input 3: Geometry as columns

Last week, we transformed our data from a `data.frame` to an `sf` object. This turned our `Lat`/`Long` Columns into a single geometry (list) column. While this is very handy for many spatial operations, accessing the coordinates directly becomes difficult. We therefore advised storing the information twice, once as a geometry and once as a numeric value. We did this for the values in `WGS84`, but yet for the `CH1903+ LV95`. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = T, include=T}

wildschwein_BE

```

Let's do the same for the `CH1903+ LV95`-Value, we will need the values in columns for our next task. First, we have to extract the Coordinates using `st_coordinates()`. We can store these values in a new variable and display them:

```{r, echo = T, eval = T, include=T}
# Store coordinates in a new variable
coordinates <- st_coordinates(wildschwein_BE)

head(coordinates)
```

Note that that the column are named `X` and `Y`, while [CH1903+ LV95](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/wissen-fakten/geodaesie-vermessung/neue-koordinaten.html) names the Axes `E` and `N`: let's rename the columns appropriately. After this, we can use `cbind()` to "glue" the columns to our original `sf`-object.

```{r, echo = T, eval = T, include=T}
colnames(coordinates) <- c("E","N")

wildschwein_BE <- cbind(wildschwein_BE,coordinates)
```


### Task 3: Euclidean Distance and Speed

In this task we will calculate the animal's speed based on the distance and timelag in between locations. Since we have 

- If you're working with dplyr, you can add `samplingInt` to `group_by()` (in addition to TierID) and so make sure you're not calculating speed across different sampling intervals. 
- You can use the function `euclid()` from the `CMAtools` package to calculate Euclidean distances between subsequent rows. Use ?euclid to see what the function expects and returns. 
- use `lead(E,1)` to address the the row `n+1`
- make sure you're clear in what unit you are measuring speed. Meters per second is a SI base unit, but might be unhandy for the speeds travelled by wild boar.

```{r}
## Task 3 ####################

library(CMAtools)

wildschwein_BE <- wildschwein_BE %>%
  group_by(TierID,samplingInt) %>%
  mutate(
    steplength = euclid(lead(E),lead(N),E,N),
    speed = steplength/timelag
  )



```
### Task 4: Rolling window functions

Measuring speed between subsequent samples is great, but especially for short sampling intervals they can be misleading due to measurement error. It might be desirable to *smoothen* these errors using a [moving window function](https://docs.wavefront.com/images/5sec_moving_window.png). The `zoo` package offers a variate of moving window functions (`roll*`). Use `roll_mean()` to smooth the calculated speed. Familiarise yourself with this function by working on some dummy data, for example:

```{r, include=T, results=F}

library(zoo)

example <- rnorm(10)
rollmean(example,k = 3,fill = NA,align = "left")
rollmean(example,k = 4,fill = NA,align = "left")

```
Visualize the output from your moving windows and compare different window sizes (`k = `). 


```{r}
## Task 4 ####################


wildschwein_BE <- wildschwein_BE %>%
  group_by(TierID) %>%
  mutate(
    speed2 = rollmean(speed,3,NA,align = "left"),
    speed3 = rollmean(speed,5,NA,align = "left"),
    speed4 = rollmean(speed,10,NA,align = "left")
  )

wildschwein_BE[1:30,] %>%
  gather(key,val,c(speed,speed2,speed3,speed4)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(DatetimeUTC,val,colour = key,group = key)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() 
```

### Task 5: Segmenting methods

You've read @laube2011 about segmenting trajectories. In the paper, they define "*static*" fixes as "*those whose average Euclidean distance to other fixes inside a temporal window *v* is less than some threshold *d**". This sounds more complicated than it is, the figure illustrates the method nicely.

![](02_Images/laube_2011.jpg)

Try to implement this method on some dummy data. Once you've solved the problem on this simple data, we will implement it on the wild boar data next week. 

```{r, include = T, purl = F}
set.seed(10)
X = cumsum(rnorm(20))
Y = cumsum(rnorm(20))

plot(X,Y, type = "l")
```

Assume the sampling interval is 5 minutes. If we take a temporal window of 20 minutes, that would mean we include 5 fixes into the calculation. We need to calculate the following Euclidean distances (pos representing a `X`,`Y`-position):

1. pos[n-2] to pos[n]
2. pos[n-1] to pos[n]
3. pos[n] to pos[n+1]
4. pos[n] to pos[n+2]

You can use the function `euclid()` to calculate the distances and `dplyr` functions `lead()/``lag()` to create the necessary offsets. On our dummy data, we want to calculate the mean of the following distances (red, dotted lines).

```{r, purl = F, echo = F, include = T}
library(ggrepel)

df <- data.frame(X = X, Y = Y)

df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    Xm2 = lag(X,2),
    Ym2 = lag(Y,2),
    Xm1 = lag(X,1),
    Ym1 = lag(Y,1),    
    Xp1 = lead(X,1),
    Yp1 = lead(Y,1),    
    Xp2 = lead(X,2),
    Yp2 = lead(Y,2)
  )

n = 6
ggplot(df, aes(X,Y)) +
  geom_path() +
    geom_segment(data = df[n,], aes(x = Xm2,y = Ym2,xend = X,yend = Y),
                 alpha = 0.8,lty = "twodash",lwd = 1, colour = "red", inherit.aes = FALSE )+
    geom_segment(data = df[n,], aes(x = Xm1,y = Ym1,xend = X,yend = Y),
                 alpha = 0.8,lty = "twodash", lwd = 1, colour = "red", inherit.aes = FALSE )+
    geom_segment(data = df[n,], aes(x = Xp1,y = Yp1,xend = X,yend = Y),
                 alpha = 0.8,lty = "twodash", lwd = 1, colour = "red", inherit.aes = FALSE )+
    geom_segment(data = df[n,], aes(x = Xp2,y = Yp2,xend = X,yend = Y),
                 alpha = 0.8,lty = "twodash", lwd = 1, colour = "red", inherit.aes = FALSE ) +
  # coord_fixed(1) +
  geom_label_repel(data = df[n,], aes(x = X, y = Y),label = "pos n", nudge_x = 1) +
  geom_label_repel(data = df[n,], aes(x = Xp1, y = Yp1),label = "pos n+1",nudge_x = -1) +
  geom_label_repel(data = df[n,], aes(x = Xp2, y = Yp2),label = "pos n+2") +
  geom_label_repel(data = df[n,], aes(x = Xm2, y = Ym2),label = "pos n-2",nudge_y = 1) +
  geom_label_repel(data = df[n,], aes(x = Xm1, y = Ym1),label = "pos n-1") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme_classic(base_size = 16)


```

```{r}

## Task 5 ####################

nMinus2 <- euclid(lag(X, 2),lag(Y, 2),X,Y)  # distance to pos. -10 minutes
nMinus1 <- euclid(lag(X, 1),lag(Y, 1),X,Y)  # distance to pos.  -5 minutes
nPlus1  <- euclid(X,Y,lead(X, 1),lead(Y, 1)) # distance to pos   +5 mintues
nPlus2  <- euclid(X,Y,lead(X, 2),lead(Y, 2)) # distance to pos  +10 minutes

# Use cbind to bind all rows to a matrix
distances <- cbind(nMinus2,nMinus1,nPlus1,nPlus2)
distances

# This just gives us the overall mean
mean(distances, na.rm = T)

# We therefore need the function `rowMeans()`
rowmeans <- rowMeans(distances)
cbind(distances,rowmeans)

# and if we put it all together:
rowMeans(
  cbind(
    euclid(lag(X, 2),lag(Y, 2),X,Y),
    euclid(lag(X, 1),lag(Y, 1),X,Y),  
    euclid(X,Y,lead(X, 1),lead(Y, 1)), 
    euclid(X,Y,lead(X, 2),lead(Y, 2))
  )
)
