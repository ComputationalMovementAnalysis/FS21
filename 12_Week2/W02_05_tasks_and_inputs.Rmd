## Tasks and Inputs

### Task 1: Getting an overview

Calculate the time difference between subsequent rows as described in the demo (column `timelag`).
First, inspect your data in more detail. Try to answer the following questions:

- How many individuals were tracked? 
- For how long were the individual tracked? Are there gaps?
- Were all individuals tracked concurrently or sequentially? 
- What is the temporal sampling interval between the locations?


Here are some exemplary visualisation you could produce to answer these questions. Can you now answer the above questions?


```{r, code =  mydecrypt("12_Week2/solutions/task_1.R",".passphrase"), opts.label="solution_showOutput"}
```


### Input: Geometry as columns

Last week, we transformed our data from a `data.frame` to an `sf` object. This turned our `Lat`/`Long` columns into a single geometry (list) column. While this is very handy for many spatial operations, accessing the coordinates directly becomes difficult. We therefore suggest storing the information twice, once as a geometry and once as a numeric value. To do this, we have to extract the Coordinates using `st_coordinates()`. We can store these values in a new variable and display them:

```{r, opts.label="example_showOutput"}
# Store coordinates in a new variable

coordinates <- st_coordinates(wildschwein_BE)

head(coordinates)
```

Note that that the column are named `X` and `Y`, while [`CH1903+ LV95`](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/wissen-fakten/geodaesie-vermessung/neue-koordinaten.html) names the Axes `E` and `N`: let's rename the columns appropriately. After this, we can use `cbind()` to "glue" the columns to our original `sf`-object.

```{r, opts.label="example_showOutput"}
colnames(coordinates) <- c("E","N")

wildschwein_BE <- cbind(wildschwein_BE,coordinates)

head(wildschwein_BE)
```

```{r}
#- chunkend
```

### Task 2: Deriving movement parameters I: Speed

In this task we will derive some additional movement parameters from our trajectories. So far our trajectories only consist of a list of time-stamped spatial locations. So let's calculate the animal's steplength based on the Euclidean distance between two subsequent locations. 

- You can calculate the Euclidean distance with the following formula: `sqrt((E1-E2)^2+(N1-N2)^2)`
- use `lead(E,1)` to address the the row `n+1` (i.e. E2)

Why do we use `E` and `N` when calculating the Euclidean distance, and not `Lat`/`Long`? Now calculate the animals' speed between subsequent locations based on the steplength as calculated in the previous task and the timelag between the locations. What speed unit do you get?

```{r, code =  mydecrypt("12_Week2/solutions/task_2.R",".passphrase"), opts.label="solution_hideOutput"}
```


### Task 3: Cross-scale movement analysis

@laube2011 analyse animal movement across different scales (see below). We will do the same on a *subset* of our data.


```{r, fig.cap="Black points are used in calculation of movement parameters (e.g. speed) at a given termporal scale (Laube and Purves, 2011)"}
knitr::include_graphics("02_Images/laube_2011_2.jpg")
```


#### Import "Caro60"

In the first task, we saw that the animals are sampled at different frequencies. To simplify the task, we've prepared a dataset that includes 200 locations of a single wild boar with a constant sampling interval of 60 seconds. Import this dataset named "caro60.csv" (available on moodle) just like you imported the other wild boar data. **NOTE:** We've converted the positions to CH1903+ LV95 for your convenience. Consider this when transforming to `sf`!
Save this data to a new variable (we will use `caro60`).

```{r, code =  mydecrypt("12_Week2/solutions/task_3.R",".passphrase"), opts.label="solution_hideOutput"}
```

#### Resample 

Now manually reduce the granularity of our sampling interval by selecting every 3^rd^, 6^th^ and 9^th^ position. 

If you like to stick to the `tidyverse` approach, you can use `slice()` to subset the dataset by row number. Slice takes an integer vector. Eg: `slice(dataset, 1:10)`, returns the first 10 rows of a dataset, `slice(dataset, c(1,5,10))` returns the 1^st^, 5^th^ and 10^th^ value of a dataset. Save each re-sampled dataset in a new variable. We will use `caro60_3`, `caro60_6` and `caro60_9`.

You should now have  4 data sets with different number of rows:

```{r, opts.label="example_showOutput"}
nrow(caro60)
nrow(caro60_3)
nrow(caro60_6)
nrow(caro60_9)
```

#### Update derived parameters

`timelag`, `steplength` and `speed` now have to be recalculated for the three re-sampled data sets. Do so as we illustrated in the Chapter *Demo*. 



#### Visualize 
Compare the speeds in a line plot and visualize the trajectories in a map (see examples below). Interpret the line plot, what do the different lines for the different temporal granularities tell you?

We've stored the geographic location of our point in the trajectory in three different forms in our dataset. Once as a `geometry`, once as `E`/`N` and once as `lat`/`long`. In our view, it is most practical to use the `E`/`N` (integer) columns of our data to map them in this task

- `geom_sf()` does not plot lines, just points
- Therefore, use `geom_path()` *and* `geom_point()` rather than `geom_sf()` within `ggplot`
- In contrast to `geom_sf()`, you have to explicitly specify  the `x`/`y` columns (in our case `E`/`N`) with `geom_path()`/`geom_point()`
- `geom_line()` does not work when mapping trajectory data, since it connects the observations *in order of the variable on the x axis*. `geom_path()` connects the observations in the order in which they appear in the data


```{r, code =  mydecrypt("12_Week2/solutions/task_3.R",".passphrase"), opts.label="solution_showOutput"}
```


### Task 4: Deriving movement parameters II: Rolling window functions


A different approach would be to *smoothen* the derived parameters using a [moving window function](https://docs.wavefront.com/images/5sec_moving_window.png). The `zoo` package offers a variate of moving window functions (`roll_*`). Use `roll_mean()` to smooth the calculated speed. Familiarise yourself with this function by working on some dummy data, for example:


```{r, opts.label="example_showOutput"}
library(zoo)

example <- rnorm(10)
rollmean(example,k = 3,fill = NA,align = "left")
rollmean(example,k = 4,fill = NA,align = "left")


```

Now run `rollmean`on the `speed` variable of the subset (`caro60`). Visualize the output from your moving windows and compare different window sizes (`k = `).

```{r, code =  mydecrypt("12_Week2/solutions/task_4.R",".passphrase"), opts.label="solution_hideOutput"}
```

### Task 5 (optional): Calculate turning angles

Just like we did with `speed` in tasks 2 - 4, we could do the same with turning angles of the trajectory. If you like a challenge, try to calculate these with the same approach! Warning: this task is pretty complex. Note, as this task is optional, you don't have to include it in your mandatory submission of Exercise 2!

```{r, code =  mydecrypt("12_Week2/solutions/task_5.R",".passphrase"), opts.label="solution_hideOutput"}
```
