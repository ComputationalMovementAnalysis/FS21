Watch this video on youtube for a nice introduction into the project. The project investigates the spatiotemporal movement patterns of wild boar (Sus scrofa) in agricultural landscapes. We will study the trajectories of these wild boar, practicing the most basic analysis tasks of Computational Movement Analysis (CMA). Please note: we are given application data from an ongoing research project. Capturing wild living animals and then equipping them with GPS collars is a very labor and cost intensive form of research. Consequently, data resulting such campaigns is a very valuable asset that must be protected. So, please do not pass on this data, for any use beyond this module contact Patrick Laube or the data owner Stefan Suter (suts@zhaw.ch).

As recommended in Wickham and Grolemund (2017), remove the option Restore .RData into workspace at startup and set the option save workspace to .RData on exit to Never. Create a new .R (or .Rmd) File and divide it into the sections necessary in a classical Data Science Workflow. In .R Files, Sections can be created within RStudio by adding Comments (#) with at least 4 trailing dashes, equal, or pound signs ( -, =,#). In .Rmd Files, their are created with leading pound signs (#). Sections allow code folding (try clicking on the small triangle next to the line number) and facilitate navigation (try the shortcut: Shift+Alt+J). We recommend following sections: Loading environment / libraries Data import Data cleansing Data analysis and visualization Task 2: Import data In section data import, import the file wildschwein_BE.csv. Obtain this file from moodle. Note: If your are using a graphical tool to import your code, make sure you save the corresponding code in your R Script. This is important in regard to the reproducibility of your script and will ensure that your workflow is documented without gaps. Wed rather recommend to move away from using graphical tools and focus on using code. We recommend using one of the tidyverse functions from the readr package to import your data (they all begin with \"read_*, note the underscore). These functions are less error prone than the base R functions (read.*). Specifically for the wild boar data, we recommend read_delim(). If you use read_delim() and receive warnings during import, have a look at these warnings by using the function problems(). Resolve these problems until import runs without warnings. Assign correct data types as necessary and make sure the time zone is set correctly for the date/time column. For everyone working on the RStudio Server: You will first need to upload this data to the server using the upload-button in the Files tab. Task 3: Explore Data We will use a range of different visualization tools (i.e. R-packages) in this course. Several packages techniques have emerged in recent years, each with their specific strengths and weaknesses. While base::plot()is quick and simple, it not very scalable with growing complexity. ggplot2 offers solutions for most use cases and has an elegant, consistent syntax that is easy to get accustomed to. We will get to know other techniques later in the course. Get an overview of your data by creating a first map-like plot of your data producing a simple scatter plot with ggplot2. Setting up a ggplot with our data is done using the command ggplot(wildschwein_BE, aes(Long, Lat, colour = TierID)). Creating a map is done via the basic scatter plot command geom_point(). Assigning every individual its own colour is done using the ggplot argument colour =. Save your code in the appropriate section. Input: Handling spatial data Until now, weve stored our location data within data frames as Lat/Long columns. This works well for many tasks, but sometimes we need special spatial classes to handle our trajectories. We will get to know such cases in our next tasks, but first we need to convert our data.frame into a spatial object. Some of you might be familiar with the sp package with the classes SpatialPoints, SpatialPointsDataFrame and so on. These packages are mostly replaced by the fairly new package sf. This packages has some huge advantages over sp: simple features are essentially data frames with minor extensions and thus are easily integratable in standard workflows they are programmed to cleanly interface with the tidyverse methods (specifically dplyrs mutate and summarise) comply with the common Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards (ISO 19125-1:2004) and interface with other important spatial tools such as GDAL, PostGIS, GeoJSON and so fourth are being rapidly implemented in visualisation tools such as ggplot2, plotly and tmap We will largely rely on sfwhen working with vector data in R. In order to transform our data.frame into an sf object, we need to use the function st_as_sf() while specifying the columns storing the coordinates and the coordinate reference system1. library(sf) wildschwein_BE_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(wildschwein_BE, coords = c(&quot;Long&quot;, &quot;Lat&quot;), crs = 4326) Notice how st_as_sf takes the EPSG code for the crs = argument. This is so much easier and more elegant than using PROJ.4 or WKT. You can find a lot of useful information on Coordinate Reference Systems (including EPSG Codes , etc.) under spatialreference.org or http://epsg.io. Lets compare our original data.frame with this new sf object: wildschwein_BE ## # A tibble: 51,246 x 6 ## TierID TierName CollarID DatetimeUTC Lat Long ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:00:12 47.0 7.05 ## 2 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:15:16 47.0 7.05 ## 3 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:30:43 47.0 7.05 ## 4 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:46:07 47.0 7.05 ## 5 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:00:22 47.0 7.05 ## 6 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:15:10 47.0 7.05 ## 7 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:30:13 47.0 7.05 ## 8 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:45:11 47.0 7.05 ## 9 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 23:00:27 47.0 7.05 ## 10 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 23:15:41 47.0 7.05 ## # ... with 51,236 more rows wildschwein_BE_sf ## Simple feature collection with 51246 features and 4 fields ## geometry type: POINT ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 7.019889 ymin: 46.97125 xmax: 7.112075 ymax: 47.01882 ## geographic CRS: WGS 84 ## # A tibble: 51,246 x 5 ## TierID TierName CollarID DatetimeUTC geometry ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;POINT [°]&gt; ## 1 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:00:12 (7.049618 46.99317) ## 2 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:15:16 (7.049509 46.99416) ## 3 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:30:43 (7.049406 46.99383) ## 4 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:46:07 (7.049217 46.99375) ## 5 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:00:22 (7.049359 46.99375) ## 6 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:15:10 (7.049363 46.99382) ## 7 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:30:13 (7.049326 46.99387) ## 8 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:45:11 (7.049237 46.99395) ## 9 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 23:00:27 (7.048383 46.99481) ## 10 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 23:15:41 (7.049396 46.99373) ## # ... with 51,236 more rows As you can see, st_as_sf() has added some metadata to our dataframe (geometry type, dimension, bbox, epsg and proj4string) and replaced the columns Lat and Long with a column named geometry. Other than that, the new sf object is very similar to our original dataframe. In fact, sf objects are essentially dataframes, just ask R: is.data.frame(wildschwein_BE_sf) ## [1] TRUE All operations we know from handling data.frames can be used on the sf object. Try some out! # subset rows wildschwein_BE_sf[1:10,] wildschwein_BE_sf[wildschwein_BE_sf$TierName == &quot;Sabi&quot;,] # subset colums wildschwein_BE_sf[,2:3] Instead of keeping the same data twice (once as a data.frame, and once as an sf object), we will overwrite the data.frame and continue working with the sf object from now on. This saves some memory space in R and avoids confusion. wildschwein_BE = st_as_sf(wildschwein_BE, coords = c(&quot;Long&quot;, &quot;Lat&quot;), crs = 4326) rm(wildschwein_BE_sf) # we can remove this sf object, since it just eats up our memory Task 4: Project data from WGS84 So what can we do with our new sf object that we couldnt before? One example is projecting the WGS84 (Lat/Long) coordinates into the new Swiss CRS CH1903+ LV952. Do this by using the function st_transform. By the way, do you notice a pattern here? The package sf names most functions for spatial operations with the prefix st_*, just as in PostGIS. Heres the resulting sf object from the operation: ## Simple feature collection with 51246 features and 4 fields ## geometry type: POINT ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 2568153 ymin: 1202306 xmax: 2575154 ymax: 1207609 ## projected CRS: CH1903+ / LV95 ## # A tibble: 51,246 x 5 ## TierID TierName CollarID DatetimeUTC geometry ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;POINT [m]&gt; ## 1 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:00:12 (2570409 1204752) ## 2 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:15:16 (2570402 1204863) ## 3 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:30:43 (2570394 1204826) ## 4 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:46:07 (2570379 1204817) ## 5 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:00:22 (2570390 1204818) ## 6 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:15:10 (2570390 1204825) ## 7 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:30:13 (2570387 1204831) ## 8 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:45:11 (2570381 1204840) ## 9 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 23:00:27 (2570316 1204935) ## 10 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 23:15:41 (2570393 1204815) ## # ... with 51,236 more rows Input: Calculate Convex Hull Transforming from one Coordinate Reference System to another was one operation where we needed an object with a spatial nature. In this way, we were able to use an off the shelf function to project the coordinates from one CRS to another. In our next example, we again rely on a spatial function: We want to calculate a convex hull per Wild boar. And guess what the function for calculating a convex hull is called in sf? If you guessed st_convex_hull(), you were right! By default st_convex_hull() calculates the convex hull per feature, i.e. per point in our dataset. This of course makes little sense. In order to calculate the convex hull per animal, we need to convert our point- to multipoint-features where each feature contains all positions of one animal. This is achieved in two steps: First: add a grouping variable to the sf object. Note the new grouping variable in the metadata of the sf object. Other than that, group_by has no effect on our sf object. wildschwein_BE_grouped &lt;- group_by(wildschwein_BE,TierID) wildschwein_BE_grouped ## Simple feature collection with 51246 features and 4 fields ## geometry type: POINT ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 2568153 ymin: 1202306 xmax: 2575154 ymax: 1207609 ## projected CRS: CH1903+ / LV95 ## # A tibble: 51,246 x 5 ## # Groups: TierID [3] ## TierID TierName CollarID DatetimeUTC geometry ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;POINT [m]&gt; ## 1 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:00:12 (2570409 1204752) ## 2 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:15:16 (2570402 1204863) ## 3 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:30:43 (2570394 1204826) ## 4 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 21:46:07 (2570379 1204817) ## 5 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:00:22 (2570390 1204818) ## 6 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:15:10 (2570390 1204825) ## 7 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:30:13 (2570387 1204831) ## 8 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 22:45:11 (2570381 1204840) ## 9 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 23:00:27 (2570316 1204935) ## 10 002A Sabi 12275 2014-08-22 23:15:41 (2570393 1204815) ## # ... with 51,236 more rows Second: use summarise() to dissolve all points into a mulipoint object. wildschwein_BE_smry &lt;- summarise(wildschwein_BE_grouped) wildschwein_BE_smry ## Simple feature collection with 3 features and 1 field ## geometry type: MULTIPOINT ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 2568153 ymin: 1202306 xmax: 2575154 ymax: 1207609 ## projected CRS: CH1903+ / LV95 ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## TierID geometry ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;MULTIPOINT [m]&gt; ## 1 002A ((2568903 1206200), (2568925 1206207), (2568980 1206197), (2569024 120~ ## 2 016A ((2569231 1205823), (2569245 1205925), (2569247 1206027), (2569251 120~ ## 3 018A ((2568153 1205611), (2568155 1205613), (2568161 1205624), (2568162 120~ Now we can run st_convex_hull on the new sf object. mcp &lt;- st_convex_hull(wildschwein_BE_smry) Task 5: Ploting spatial objects Using base plot to visualize sf objects is easy enough, just try the following code. plot(mcp) But since we use ggplot extensively, try and plot the object mcp with ggplot. Hint: Use the layer geom_sf() to add an sf object. Note: ggplot refuses to use our specified CRS, so we need to force this by specifying datum = in coord_sf(). Try it out. Input: Importing raster data In the next task, we would like to add a background map to our mcp object. To do this, we have to the raster data into R first. For this, we use the package raster with the function brick. library(raster) pk100_BE &lt;- brick(&quot;00_Rawdata/pk100_BE_2056.tif&quot;) pk100_BE ## class : RasterBrick ## dimensions : 1821, 2321, 4226541, 4 (nrow, ncol, ncell, nlayers) ## resolution : 5, 5 (x, y) ## extent : 2567000, 2578605, 1199996, 1209101 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## crs : +proj=somerc +lat_0=46.9524055555556 +lon_0=7.43958333333333 +k_0=1 +x_0=2600000 +y_0=1200000 +ellps=bessel +units=m +no_defs ## source : C:/Users/rata/switchdrive/Lehre/Master/Pattern_and_Trends/2021_FS/00_Rawdata/pk100_BE_2056.tif ## names : pk100_BE_2056.1, pk100_BE_2056.2, pk100_BE_2056.3, pk100_BE_2056.4 ## min values : 0, 0, 0, 0 ## max values : 255, 255, 255, 255 pk100_BE_2056.tif is a three layered geotiff File. The above console output shows some metadata including the resolution, extent and the names of our layers (pk100_BE_2056.1, pk100_BE_2056.2etc). For some reason, RasterBrick imported a fourth layer (pk100_BE_2056.4). plot() shows that the fourth layer is empty. We will remove this layer using subset(). plot(pk100_BE) pk100_BE &lt;- subset(pk100_BE,1:3) plot(pk100_BE) Task 6: Adding a background map There are multiple ways to add a background map in ggplot, many require additional packages. This is a good opportunity to get to know a completely different package for creating maps: tmap (thematic map). This package was developed with a syntax very similar to ggplot2, which makes it easy to learn. library(tmap) tm_shape(pk100_BE) + tm_rgb() As you can see, plotting layers in tmap is combined with the + sign, just as in ggplot2. In tmap however, each layer consists of two objects: a tm_shape() in which the data is called, and a tm_* object in which we define how the data is visualized (tm_rgb() states that it is plotted as an RGB Raster Layer). Add the object mcp to the plot in this manner. Read the vignette if you are having trouble. Task 7: Create an interactive map Rerun the tmap()... command from the previous task, but switch the plotting mode to view\" (tmap_mode(\"view\")) beforehand. Omit the raster layer (pk100_BE), you wont be needing it. At this point, we assume you know what a Coordinate Reference Systems is. Check out this link if this is not the case. As weve mentioned in the first Input, you can look up the EPSG codes under spatialreference.org or http://epsg.io.
