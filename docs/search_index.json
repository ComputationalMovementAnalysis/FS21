Watch this video on youtube for a nice introduction into the project. The project investigates the spatiotemporal movement patterns of wild boar (Sus scrofa) in agricultural landscapes. We will study the trajectories of these wild boar, practicing the most basic analysis tasks of Computational Movement Analysis (CMA). Please note: we are given application data from an ongoing research project. Capturing wild living animals and then equipping them with GPS collars is a very labor and cost intensive form of research. Consequently, data resulting such campaigns is a very valuable asset that must be protected. So, please do not pass on this data, for any use beyond this module contact Patrick Laube or the data owner Stefan Suter (suts@zhaw.ch). "],["W01_01_exercise.html", "Exercise 1", " Exercise 1 This exercise covers the necessary steps for getting ready in R and some basic concepts for setting up a well-structured R project. The lesson introduces how additional packages that provide useful functions for data science are made available and how spatial data is handled. The exercise concludes with the creation of your first map featuring movement data. "],["W01_02_outcomes.html", "Learning outcomes", " Learning outcomes You learn how to structure an R project. You can read movement data from a .csv-file into a data.frame You can convert spatial point data from a data.frame to a spatial object sf You can perform basic spatial operations on spatial objects in R You can produce simple maps of your spatial data using ggplot2 You can produce simple maps of your spatial data using tmap "],["W01_03_prerequesites.html", "Prerequisites", " Prerequisites Readings Skills from R for Data Science (Wickham and Grolemund 2017): RS1.1 Preface (16p, ix-xxiv) RS1.2 Chap2 Workflow basics (3p, 37-39) RS1.3 Chap4 Workflow scripts (3p, 77-79) RS1.4 Chap6 workflow projects (6p, 111-116) RS1.5 Chap8 Data Import with readr (21p) RS1.6 Chap13 Date and Times with lubridate (18p, 237-256) "],["W01_04_preperations.html", "Preperation", " Preperation Check you Version of R Check your Version of R by opening RStudio and typing the following command into the console. R.version.string ## [1] &quot;R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10)&quot; This returns the version number of your R installation, whereas the first digit (4) indicates the number of the major release, the second digit (0) indicates the minor release and the last digit (3) refers to the patch release. As a general rule of thumb, you will want to update R if you dont have the current major version or are lagging two (or more) versions behind the current minor release In the time of writing (April, 2021), the current R Version is 4.0.5 (released on 2021-03-31 07:05:15, see cran.r-project.org). Your installation should therefore not be older than 4.0.0. If it is, make sure that you have updated R until next week (doing it now will probabbly take too long). Check these instructions on how to update R Check your Version of RStudio RStudio is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) we use in our course to interact with R. RStudio should not be too old either and we recommend updating if you dont have the latest version: check if this is the case by clicking on help &gt; check for updates. If you need to update RStudio, dont update now but have a newer version of RStudio installed before next week. Install the necessary packages If you havent already, install the packages tidyverse, sf and terra(using install.packages()). Install Git Next, install Git. If you are not sure whether you already have Git installed or not, you can verify this by typing git --version in the terminal (there is a terminal built into RStudio which you can use for this. By default, it is situated in the bottom left corner in the tab named Terminal). If this command returns a version number you have Git installed already and might only need to update it. If this command returns git: command not found (or something similar), you will need to install Git first. Windows: We recommend installing Git for Windows, also known as msysgit or Git Bash. When asked about Adjusting your PATH environment, select Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software RStudio prefers Git to be installed in C:/Program Files/Git, we recommend following this convention Otherwise, we believe it is good to accept the defaults macOS: We recommend you install the Xcode command line tools (not all of Xcode), which includes Git Go to the shell and enter xcode-select --install to install developer command line tools Linux: On Ubuntu or Debian Linux: sudo apt-get install git On Fedora or RedHat Linux: sudo yum install git Configure RStudio Now we will set some RStudio Global options. But first, close all instances of RStudio and restart it (!!!). Then go to Tools &gt; Global options. R General Deactivate the option Restore .RData into workspace at startup Set Save workspace to .RData on exit to Never Git / SVN Activate the option Enable version control interface for RStudio projects If the Field Git executable: shows (Not Found), browse to your git installation (previous step). This path should look something like this: Windows: C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe (not C:/Program Files/Git/cmd/git.exe or git-bash.exe) Linux / macOS: /usr/bin/git Prepare the folder structure for this course By this point, you probably have created a folder for this course somewhere on your computer. In our example, we assume this folder is located here: C:/Users/yourname/semester2/Modul_CMA (mentally replace this with your actual path). Before we dive into the exercises, take a minute to think about how you are going to structure your files in this folder. This course will take place over 7 weeks, and in each week you will receive or produce various files. We recommend creating a separate folder for each week, and one folder for the semester project, like so: Course Folder (C:\\\\Users\\\\yourname\\\\semester2\\\\Modul_CMA) ¦--week1 ¦--week2 ¦--week3 ¦--week4 ¦--week5 ¦--week6 ¦--week7 °--semester_project For the R-exercises that take place in weeks 1 to 5, we recommend that you create a new RStudio Project each week in subdirectory of the appropriate week. For example, this week your folder structure could look like this: Folder Week 1 (C:\\\\Users\\\\yourname\\\\semester2\\\\Modul_CMA\\\\week1) ¦--slides.pdf ¦--my_notes.docx ¦--seminar_screenshot.jpg °--week1-rexercise ¦--week1-r.Rproj ¦--wildschwein.csv °--my_solution.Rmd Note that the RStudio Project is located in a subfolder of C:/Users/yourname/semester2/Modul_CMA/week1 and named week1-rexercise. week1-rexercise is the projects directory name and the project name we realize that that the week number is redundant, there is a reason for this1 this means each week is a fresh start (which has pros and cons) Create an RStudio project for the first week Create a new RStudio Project (File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project). Click on Browse and switch to your equivalent of the folder C:/Users/yourname/semester2/Modul_CMA/week1 (the project we are about to initiate will be be created in a subdirectory of this folder). Click on open to confirm the selection In the field Directory name, type week1-rexercise. This will be the name of your RStudio project and the its parent directory. Check the option Create a git repository Click on Create Project You will see the project names of all your RStudio Projets listed in RStudio. Having the week number in the project name keeps you from getting confused on which project you are working on.
