## Tasks and Inputs

### Input: Segmentation Ã  la @laube2011

You've read @laube2011 about segmenting trajectories. In the paper, they define "*static*" fixes as "*those whose average Euclidean distance to other fixes inside a temporal window v is less than some threshold d*", as illustrated in the following figure:

![@laube2011](02_Images/laube_2011.jpg)

(a) Temporal representation of constant sample interval with associated temporal window v for three exemplary points; 
(b) Measurement of average distance in temporal window v to sample points in spatial representation;
(c) Removal of all points where average distance is less than a given threshold, i.e. removal of static points; and 
(d) Removal of subtrajectories with less than a threshold temporal length. 

We will implement this method on some dummy data. Once you've grasped the idea on this simple data, you will implement it for the wild boar data in task 1. 

#### Segmenting

The first step is calculating the distances to samples within the temporal window *v*. Take the follwing sample data, assuming the sampling interval is 5 minutes. If we take a temporal window of 20 minutes, that would mean including 5 fixes. We need to calculate the following Euclidean distances (pos representing a `X`,`Y`-position):

1. `pos[n-2`] to `pos[n]`
2. `pos[n-1]` to `pos[n]`
3. `pos[n]` to `pos[n+1]`
4. `pos[n]` to `pos[n+2]`

```{r, echo = T, include = T, eval = T}
set.seed(10)

df <- data.frame(X = cumsum(rnorm(10)), Y = cumsum(rnorm(10)))

ggplot(df, aes(X,Y)) +
  geom_path()
```

You can use the function `euclid()` from the package `CMAtools` for calculating the distances and `dplyr` functions `lead()`/`lag()` to create the necessary offsets.


```{r, echo = T, include = T, eval = T}

df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    nMinus2 = euclid(lag(X, 2),lag(Y, 2),X,Y),   # distance to pos -10 minutes
    nMinus1 = euclid(lag(X, 1),lag(Y, 1),X,Y),   # distance to pos - 5 minutes
    nPlus1  = euclid(X,Y,lead(X, 1),lead(Y, 1)), # distance to pos + 5 mintues
    nPlus2  = euclid(X,Y,lead(X, 2),lead(Y, 2))  # distance to pos +10 minutes
  ) 

```

Now we want to calculate the mean distance of `nMinus2`, `nMinus1`, `nPlus1`, `nPlus2`. Since we want the mean value *per Row*, we have to explicitly specify this before `mutate()`. Without `rowwise()`, mutate calculates the overall mean.

```{r, echo = T, include = T, eval = T}
df <- df %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    stepMean = mean(c(nMinus2, nMinus1,nPlus1,nPlus2), na.rm = T)
  )

```

We can now determin if an animal is moving or not by specifying a threshold on `stepMean`

```{r, echo = T, include = T, eval = T}

df <- df %>% 
  mutate(
    moving = stepMean>1.5
    )

df
```


#### Unique IDs *per segment*

When segmenting trajectories, we often want to compute metrics on the basis of *each segment*. Within the tidyverse logic, we need a unique ID per segment that we can pass to `group_by()`.  So far, we've not found a good solution from available packages. We have therefore created our own function that we provide with the `CMAtools` package called `number_groups()`. This function takes a logical vector as an input and assigns subsequent `TRUE` values to the same group. Take the sample trajectory from before:

```{r, echo = T, include = T, eval = T}
df
```

We can now assign unique IDs to a sequence of `TRUE`-values with the function `number_groups()`. Use `?number_groups` to get more information on this function.
```{r, echo = T, include = T, eval = T}
df <- df %>%
  ungroup() %>%  # to remove the rowwise grouping
  mutate(
    moving_group = number_groups(moving)
  )

df
```


### Task 1: Segmentation

With the skills from the inout above we can now implement the segmentation algorithm described in @laube2011. The desribed method depends on a regular sampling interval. Therefore you have to subset your data to a trajectory of the same sampling intervals. Do so by subsetting the data the same way as we did in Task 3 last week: 

1. filter the to positions with a sampling interval between 40 and 80 seconds
2. subset the first 100 locations
3. save these positions to a new variable (we will again use `wildschwein_BE_1`)

Next, we have to have to define our *temporal window v* [@laube2011]. To keep things simple, I would suggest a window of n +/- 2 minutes. With a sampling interval of around 1 minute, this corresponds to a window size of n +/- 2 positions.

```{r}


wildschwein_BE_1 <- wildschwein_BE%>%
  filter(timelag > 40 & timelag < 80) %>%
  slice(2:100)

## Task 2 ####################

wildschwein_BE_1 <- wildschwein_BE_1 %>%
  group_by(TierID) %>%
  mutate(
    stepMean = rowMeans(                       # using rowMean() is an alternative
      cbind(                                   # to using rowwise() as described 
        euclid(lag(E, 2),lag(N, 2),E,N),       # in the demo
        euclid(lag(E, 1),lag(N, 1),E,N),
        euclid(E,N,lead(E, 1),lead(N, 1)),
        euclid(E,N,lead(E, 2),lead(N, 2))
        )
      )
  )
```

### Task 2: Specify and apply threshold *d*

After calculating the Euclidean distances to positions with the temporal window *v* in task 1, you can explore these values (we stored them in the column `stepMean`) using summary statistics (histograms, boxplot, `summary()`): This way we can define a reasonable threshold value to differentiate between "stops" and "moves". There is no "correct" way of doing this, specifying a threshold always depends on data as well as the question that needs to be answered. 



```{r, echo = F, include = T, eval = T}
## Task 2 ####################


summary(wildschwein_BE_1$stepMean)

ggplot(wildschwein_BE_1, aes(stepMean)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  lims(x = c(0,100)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 7)

wildschwein_BE_1 <- wildschwein_BE_1 %>%
  mutate(
    movement = stepMean > 7
  ) 


wildschwein_BE_1 %>%  select(DatetimeUTC,E,N,stepMean,movement)
```






### Task 3: Visualize segmented trajectories


Now visualize the segmented trajectories spatially. Just like last week, you can use ggplot with `geom_path()`, `geom_point()` and `coord_equal()`. Assign `colour = movement` within `aes()` to distinguish between segements *with* "movement" and *without*.

 

```{r, echo = F, include = T, eval = T}

p1 <- wildschwein_BE_1 %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_path(aes(E,N), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(aes(E,N,colour = movement)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_equal()

p1

```
Tipp: if you want to get a `ggplot()` with Zoom capability, just load the library `plotly` and wrap the `ggplot()` function with `ggplotly()`

```{r, echo = F, include = T, eval = T, fig.cap="This is the same plot as above, wrapped in the function `ggplotly()` from the library `plotly`. With this function, the plot becomes interactive. Try it out!"}


if (knitr::is_html_output()){                                                           # uncomment this line...
  library(plotly)
  ggplotly(p1)
} else{print("Interactive map only available in the online version of this document")}  # ... and this line

```


### Task 4: Segment-based analysis

In applying @laube2011, we've come as far as steps (b)/(c) in [Figure 1](02_Images/laube_2011.jpg). In order to complete step (d) (*Removal of subtrajectories with less than a threshold temporal length*), we first should be able to perform calculations per *segment*. This is currently not the case. 

What we are lacking is a unique name for each segment that we can use as a grouping variable. This is where the `number_group()` function which we introduced in the input becomes handy. Complete the following steps:

1. Apply the function `number_group()` on the column `movement` to get a unique ID per segement and store this ID in the column `segment_ID`
2. Use this column within `group_by()` to calculate the temporal length of each segment
3. Remove segments with a duration less than 5 minutes / 300 seconds
4. visualize the new dataset

```{r}

wildschwein_BE_1 <- wildschwein_BE_1 %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    segment_ID = number_groups(movement,T),
    segment_ID = as.factor(segment_ID)
  ) %>%
  group_by(segment_ID) %>%
  mutate(
    segment_length = difftime(max(DatetimeUTC),min(DatetimeUTC),units = "secs")
  )
```

```{r, echo = F, include = T, eval = T, fig.cap="(a): Differentiate between move/stop based on temporal window 4 minutes and a threshold of 7 meters. (b): Removal of points where avarage distance is less than 7 meters. (c): Removal of Subtrajectories with less than a temporal length of 5 minutes."}

library(cowplot)

p2 <- wildschwein_BE_1 %>%
  filter(!is.na(segment_ID)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(E,N, colour = segment_ID, group = segment_ID)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = filter(wildschwein_BE_1, is.na(segment_ID)),alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_alpha_discrete(range = c(0.1,1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_equal()
p3 <- wildschwein_BE_1 %>%
  filter(!is.na(segment_ID)) %>%
  filter(segment_length > 300) %>%
  ggplot(aes(E,N, colour = segment_ID, group = segment_ID)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = filter(wildschwein_BE_1, is.na(segment_ID)),alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_alpha_discrete(range = c(0.1,1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_equal()

  plot_grid(p1,p2,p3, labels = "auto", ncol = 1)


```

```{r, echo = F, include = T, eval = T, fig.cap="(d) Removal of subtrajectories with less than a threshold temporal length."}

```


### Task 4 (Optional): Plotting with `leaflet`

Exploring segmentation with `ggplot` is not very satisfying. Another great tool to visualize spatial data is leaflet. It's not all that hard to create an interactive leaflet plot, just take a look at [the documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and try it with your segmented wild boar data. Note: You can only pass the `Lat`/`Long` coordinates to leaflet, it cannot handle our `E`/`N`-data. This is one of the reasons we've held on to this column in the first place.

```{r, echo = F, include = T, eval = T, fig.cap="Visualizing 'stops' and 'moves' with a threshold of 50 m"}

## Task 4 (Optional) #########################

library(scales)
library(leaflet)

if (knitr::is_html_output()){                                                           # uncomment this line...
  factpal <- colorFactor(hue_pal()(3), wildschwein_BE_1$movement)

  wildschwein_BE_1 %>%
    leaflet() %>%
    addCircles(radius = 1,lng = ~Long, lat = ~Lat, color = ~factpal(movement)) %>%
    addPolylines(opacity = 0.1,lng = ~Long, lat = ~Lat) %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addLegend(pal = factpal, values = ~movement, title = "Segment")
} else{print("Interactive map only available in the online version of this document")}  # ... and this line
```


### Task 5: Similarity measures 


Import the dataset `pedestrian.csv` (available on moodle). It it a set of six similar, but varying trajectories from pedestrians walking on a path. We will analyse these trajectories with the package `SimilarityMeasures`, always comparing trajectory 1 pairwise to the other trajectories 2-6. For this task, explore the trajectories first and get an idea on how the pedestrians moved. We step away from using the wild boar data for this task because our animals don't express the type of similarity we want to illustrate here. Also, using the constructed pedestrian data allows us illustrating very typical similarity issues, that are picked-up in different ways by the different similarity measures. In later exercises we will get back to our wild boar!


```{r}

## Task 5 ##################################

library(ggrepel)
pedestrians <- read_delim("../CMA_FS2018_Filestorage/pedestrian.csv",",")

pedestrians <- pedestrians %>%
  group_by(TrajID) %>%
  mutate(index = row_number())


plotraj <- function(idx,lab = F){
  dat <- pedestrians %>%
    filter(TrajID %in% c(1,idx))
  
  p <- ggplot(dat, aes(E,N, colour = as.factor(TrajID), label = index)) +
    geom_path(colour = "grey", alpha = 0.5) + 
    geom_point() + 
    scale_color_discrete(guide = "none") +
    # labs(title = paste("Trajectories 1 and",idx)) +
    theme_minimal() +
    coord_equal()
  
  if(lab == T) p <- p + geom_text_repel(data = filter(dat,index == 1 | index %% 2 == 0),aes(E,N,label = index,colour = as.factor(TrajID)),inherit.aes = FALSE) #+ labs(subtitle = "Every second position labeled with index")
  
  p
}

```


```{r, echo = F, include = T, eval = T, fig.cap="Comparing Trajectories 1 and 2"}
plotraj(2)


```

```{r, echo = F, include = T, eval = T, fig.cap="Comparing Trajectories 1 and 3. Some positions are labeld with the position index to illustrate the direction of movement per trajectory."}
plotraj(3,T) 


```

```{r, echo = F, include = T, eval = T, fig.cap="Comparing Trajectories 1 and 4"}
plotraj(4)

```

```{r, echo = F, include = T, eval = T, fig.cap="Comparing Trajectories 1 and 5"}
plotraj(5)

```

```{r, echo = F, include = T, eval = T, fig.cap="Comparing Trajectories 1 and 6"}

plotraj(6)
```


### Task 6: Calculate similarity

Calculate the similarity between trajectory 1 and trajectories 2-6. Use the different similarity measures in the package `SimilarityMeasures`.Visualize your results and try to understand the different results with respect to your reading of @both2018. Can you see connections between the properties of the trajectories and the similarity values computed by the different measures?

Note: 

- All functions in the package need matrices as input, with one trajectory per matrix. Therefore, split the dataframe into 6 matrices with just two columns each, `E` and `N`. You can do this with the following code:
- `LCSS`takes very long to compute. The accuracy of the algorithm (`pointSpacing =` ,`pointDistance =` and `errorMarg =`) can be varied to provide faster or slower calculations. Please see @vlachos2002 for more information.


```{r, echo = T, include = T, eval = T}
traj1 <- pedestrians %>%
      filter(TrajID == 1) %>% # Change value 1 to 2,3 etc to  
      as.data.frame() %>%     # filter for the other trajectories
      dplyr::select(E,N) %>%
      as.matrix()


# This is the original data.frame:
head(pedestrians)

# ..and this is the data converted to a matrix:
head(traj1)
```


```{r}

# instead of repeating the same step 6 times, we use purrr::map() 
# which creates a list of dataframes. Feel free to use a method
# with which you feel comfortable.
pedestrians_l <- unique(pedestrians$TrajID) %>%
  map(function(x){
    pedestrians %>%
      filter(TrajID == x) %>%
      as.data.frame() %>%
      dplyr::select(E,N) %>%
      as.matrix()
  })
```


```{r, echo = F, include=T, eval = T, fig.cap="Comparing Trajectory 1 to trajectories 2 to 6"}
library(SimilarityMeasures)

# Again, we use one of the purrr::map_* family of functions
# to calculate three indicies over all 5 pairs in one go.
# As before: feel free to use a different method you feel 
# more comfortable in.
pedest_measures <- map_df(pedestrians_l, ~data_frame(
  DTW = DTW(.x,pedestrians_l[[1]]),
  EditDist = EditDist(.x,pedestrians_l[[1]]),
  Frechet = Frechet(.x,pedestrians_l[[1]]),
  LCSS = LCSS(.x,pedestrians_l[[1]],5,4,4)
  ))



pedest_measures %>%
  rownames_to_column("traj") %>%
  slice(2:nrow(.)) %>%
  gather(key,val,-traj) %>%
  ggplot(aes(traj,val))+ 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~key,scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "Trajectory", y = "Value")

```


```{r code=readLines('01_R_Files/clear_workspace.R'), echo = F, include=F, eval=T}
```
