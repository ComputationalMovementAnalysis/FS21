## Tasks and Inputs

You've read @laube2011 about segmenting trajectories. In the paper, the authors define "*static*" fixes as "*those whose average Euclidean distance to other fixes inside a temporal window v is less than some threshold d*", as illustrated in the following figure:

![](02_Images/laube_2011.jpg)

The above image from @laube2011 visualizes the following steps:

(a) Specify a temporal windows $v$ for in which to measure Euclidean distances
(b) Measure the distance from every point to every other point within this temporal window ($v$)
(c) Remove "static points": These are points  where the average distance is less than a given threshold. This segments the trajectory into subtrajectories
(d) Now remove short subtrajectories: These are trajectories with a short duration (whereas "short" is tbd)

We will demonstrate implementing this method on the wild boar "Sabi", restricting ourselves to a couple of tracking days. Your task will be to understand this implementation and apply it on Caro, with a different sampling interval.


```{r, opts.label="solution_showOutput"}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library()
wildschwein <- read_delim("00_Rawdata/wildschwein_BE_2056.csv",",")

sabi <- wildschwein %>%
  filter(TierName == "Sabi", DatetimeUTC >= "2015-07-01", DatetimeUTC < "2015-07-03")

```


```{r, opts.label="solution_showOutput", fig.cap = `r paste0("Movement of the wildboar 'Sabi' in the timespan ", stringr::str_trim(strftime(min(sabi$DatetimeUTC), "%e")), "-",strftime(max(sabi$DatetimeUTC), "%d.%m.%Y"), ". The circle highlingts possible 'static points'")`}

# ggplot(sabi, aes(x = DatetimeUTC, y = 1)) + 
#   geom_point() +
#   theme(panel.background = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank())

ggplot(sabi, aes(N, E, color = DatetimeUTC))  +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() +
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_color_datetime(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  guides(color = guide_colorbar(title.position = 'top', title.hjust = .5,
barwidth = unit(30, 'lines'), barheight = unit(.5, 'lines'))) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  geom_point(x = 1205120, y = 2570470, size = 20, pch = 21, color = "black", stroke = 4)

```




#### Segmenting

The first step is calculating the distances to temporally close samples within the temporal window *v*. In the above dataset, the sampling interval is 15 minutes. If we take a temporal window of 60 minutes, that would mean including 5 fixes. We need to calculate the following Euclidean distances (pos representing single location):

1. `pos[n-2`] to `pos[n]`
2. `pos[n-1]` to `pos[n]`
3. `pos[n]` to `pos[n+1]`
4. `pos[n]` to `pos[n+2]`

Just like last week, we use the formula for calculating the Euclidean distance in in combination with `lead()` and `lag()`. For example, to create the necessary offset of n-2, we use `lag(x, 2)`. For each offset, we create one individual column.


```{r, opts.label="example_showOutput"}

sabi <- sabi %>%
  mutate(
    nMinus2 = sqrt((lag(E,2)-E)^2+(lag(N,2)-N)^2),   # distance to pos -30 minutes
    nMinus1 = sqrt((lag(E,1)-E)^2+(lag(N,1)-N)^2),   # distance to pos -15 minutes
    nPlus1  = sqrt((E-lead(E,1))^2+(N-lead(N,1))^2), # distance to pos +15 mintues
    nPlus2  = sqrt((E-lead(E,2))^2+(N-lead(N,2))^2)  # distance to pos +30 minutes
  )

```

Now we want to calculate the mean distance of `nMinus2`, `nMinus1`, `nPlus1`, `nPlus2` for each row. Since we want the mean value *per Row*, we have to explicitly specify this before `mutate()` with the function `rowwise()`. Note the new grouping variable `Rowwise:` when printing the dataframe to the console. Also note that for the first two positions, we cannot calculate a stepMean since there is no Position `n-2` for these positions. This is also true for the last to positions (lacking a position `n+2`).

```{r, opts.label="example_showOutput"}
sabi <- sabi %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    stepMean = mean(c(nMinus2, nMinus1,nPlus1,nPlus2))
  )

sabi
```

We can now determine if an animal is moving or not by specifying a threshold on `stepMean`

```{r, opts.label="example_showOutput"}

df <- df %>% 
  mutate(
    moving = stepMean>1.5
    )

df

ggplot(df, aes(X,Y)) +
  geom_path() + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = moving)) +
  coord_equal()
```



#### Unique IDs *per segment*

When segmenting trajectories, we often want to compute metrics on the basis of *each segment*. Within the tidyverse logic, we need a unique ID per segment that we can pass to `group_by()`. In other words, we need a unique ID for a sequence of successive `TRUE` values. For lack of a better way, we suggest solving this problem with `cumsum()`.

`cumsum()` returns the cummulative sum of a given vector:
```{r, opts.label="example_showOutput"}
one_to_ten <- 1:10
one_to_ten
cumsum(one_to_ten)
```

In R, `TRUE`and `FALSE` are interprated as `1` and `0` if coerced to an integer. 
```{r, opts.label="example_showOutput"}
as.integer(TRUE)
as.integer(FALSE)

TRUE+TRUE
```

Therefore, `cumsum()` on a boolean vector increases the count on each `TRUE` value:

```{r, opts.label="example_showOutput"}

boolvec <- c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE)

df_cumsum <- tibble(boolvec = boolvec,cumsum = cumsum(boolvec))

df_cumsum
```

You might have noticed that this is pretty much exactly the opposite of what we need. We therefore have to take the inverse of the boolean vector:

```{r, opts.label="example_showOutput"}

df_cumsum %>%
  mutate(
    boolvec_inverse = !boolvec,
    cumsum2 = cumsum(boolvec_inverse)
  )


```


To simplify our workflow, we can we can take the inverse of `boolvec` *within* our `cumsum()` statement and save an extra line of code.


```{r, opts.label="example_showOutput"}
df_cumsum %>%
  mutate(
    cumsum2 = cumsum(!boolvec)
  )
  
```



### Task 1: Segmentation

With the skills from the input above we can now implement the segmentation algorithm described in @laube2011. The described method depends on a regular sampling interval. Therefore, take the dataset "caro60.csv" from task 3 of last week (available on moodle). Import it as a dataframe, we don't need an `sf`-object to for today's tasks.

Next, we have to have to define our *temporal window v* [@laube2011]. To keep things simple, I would suggest a window of n +/- 2 minutes. With a sampling interval of around 1 minute, this corresponds to a window size of n +/- 2 positions.

```{r, code =  mydecrypt("13_Week3/solutions/task_1.R",".passphrase"), opts.label="solution_hideOutput"}
```



### Task 2: Specify and apply threshold *d*


After calculating the Euclidean distances to positions within the temporal window *v* in task 1, you can explore these values (we stored them in the column `stepMean`) using summary statistics (histograms, boxplot, `summary()`): This way we can define a reasonable threshold value to differentiate between "stops" and "moves". There is no "correct" way of doing this, specifying a threshold always depends on data as well as the question that needs to be answered. In this exercise, find a threshold that matches your intuition. 

Store the new information (boolean to differentiate between stops (`TRUE`) and moves (`FALSE`)) in a new column named `moving`.

```{r, code =  mydecrypt("13_Week3/solutions/task_2.R",".passphrase"), opts.label="solution_showOutput"}
```


### Task 3: Visualize segmented trajectories

Now visualize the segmented trajectory spatially. Just like last week, you can use ggplot with `geom_path()`, `geom_point()` and `coord_equal()`. Assign `colour = moving` within `aes()` to distinguish between segments *with* "movement" and *without*.

```{r, code =  mydecrypt("13_Week3/solutions/task_3.R",".passphrase"), opts.label="solution_showOutput"}
```


Tip: if you want to get a `ggplot()` with Zoom capability, just load the library `plotly` and wrap the `ggplot()` function with `ggplotly()`


```{r, echo = F, include=T, eval = knitr::is_latex_output(), results = "asis", purl = F}
pander::pandoc.image("02_Images/w03_ex3_p1.jpg","This is the same plot as above, wrapped in the function `ggplotly()` from the library `plotly`. With this function, the plot becomes interactive. However, the interactive map/plot is only available in the online version of this document.")
```



### Task 4: Segment-based analysis

In applying @laube2011, we've come as far as steps (b)/(c) in [Figure 1](02_Images/laube_2011.jpg). In order to complete step (d) (*Removal of subtrajectories with less than a threshold temporal length*), we have to calculate each segment's temporal duration. 

In order to do this, we need a *unique* name for each segment that we can use as a grouping variable. This is where the `cumsum()` approach which we introduced in the input comes useful. Complete the following steps:

1. Filter the data by removing all rows where `moving` equals to `NA` (typically these are the the first and last 2 rows). 
2. Get a unique ID per segment and using the `cumsum()` approach we introduced in the input. Store this ID in a new column `segment_ID`
3. Filter the data to remove all rows where the animal is not moving 
4. Group by the column `segment_ID` to calculate the temporal length of each segment with `mutate()`.
5. Remove segments with a duration less than 3 minutes
6. inspect your data visually


```{r, code =  mydecrypt("13_Week3/solutions/task_4.R",".passphrase"), opts.label="solution_showOutput"}
```


### Task 5: Similarity measures 

Import the dataset `pedestrian.csv` (available on moodle) as a dataframe (you don't need an `sf` object). It it a set of six different but similar trajectories from pedestrians walking on a path. Explore this data visually.

We will analyse these trajectories with the package `SimilarityMeasures`, always comparing trajectory 1 pairwise to the other trajectories 2-6. For this task, explore the trajectories first and get an idea on how the pedestrians moved. We step away from using the wild boar data for this task because our animals don't express the type of similarity we want to illustrate here. Also, using the constructed pedestrian data allows us illustrating very typical similarity issues, that are picked-up in different ways by the different similarity measures. In later exercises we will get back to our wild boar!

```{r, code =  mydecrypt("13_Week3/solutions/task_5.R",".passphrase"), opts.label="solution_showOutput"}
```




### Task 6: Calculate similarity


Calculate the similarity between trajectory 1 and trajectories 2-6. Use the different similarity measures in the package `SimilarityMeasures`. Visualize your results and try to understand the different results with respect to your reading of @both2018. Can you see connections between the properties of the trajectories and the similarity values computed by the different measures?

Note: 

- All functions in the package need matrices as input, with one trajectory per matrix. 
- `LCSS`takes very long to compute. The accuracy of the algorithm (`pointSpacing =` ,`pointDistance =` and `errorMarg =`) can be varied to provide faster calculations. Please see @vlachos2002 for more information.


```{r, code =  mydecrypt("13_Week3/solutions/task_6.R",".passphrase"), opts.label="solution_showOutput"}
