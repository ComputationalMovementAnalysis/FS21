The project investigates the spatiotemporal movement patterns of wild boar (Sus scrofa) in agricultural landscapes. For more information you can ask Beni Sigrist, one of the course participants involved in this project. We will study the trajectories of these wild boar, practicing the most basic analysis tasks of Computational Movement Analysis (CMA). Please note we are given this data under the condition of signing a non-disclosure agreement. Why? This is data coming out of an ongoing research project. Capturing wild living animals and then equipping them with GPS collars is a very labor and cost intensive form of research. Consequently, data resulting such campaigns is a very valuable asset that must be protected.
